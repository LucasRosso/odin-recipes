This will be my first Odin's project.

I'll be implementing what I've learnt of console (CLI) commands, GIT/Github and HTML boilerplate to build a RECIPE.

Well, the whole project was to build three (or more) recipes with relative links.

I had to use commands such as: img, a href, ol & ul lists, br, p, h1 & h4.
